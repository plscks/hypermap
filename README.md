Nexus Clash Breath 5 Hypermap
---
Welcome to the [Nexus Clash](https://www.nexusclash.com) map repository! Within the repository there are blank templates
of the maps that will be displayed from this repository into the game map page.

This might seem like a strange setup, but I think that it opens up the opportunity for the community
to get move involved with the game especially where it comes to mapping! Lots of people seem to really enjoy mapping
the game when new areas open up and end up making maps in various spreadsheets. My line of thought here, was why not
provide a template for what an official map will end up actually being, a .png graphical asset.

If people
would like to, they can map directly on a downloaded copy of the template and then put in a Pull Request here at this
repository and I can pull it into the main repo, in this way, new areas can actually be mapped in real time (or at least as
pull requests are issued) for the entire community!


There are copies of the blank templates within the repo labeled as `{MAPNAME}_template.png`, if you use them to create a PR,
please rename them to just `{MAPNAME}.png` where `{MAPNAME}` is the corresponding plane name, also be aware that even though
Centrum and Outer Centrum are different planes in the game, they just so happen to overlay on top of each other perfectly
and as such that is how they will be displayed on the map.

If you are a contributor or if you contribute to the project but are not the one to make the pull request, I would
just like to thank you very very much! Me, the dev team, and I'm the rest of the community thank you for contributing!

### Note on Additional Features
At this time I do not have anything specific planned as far as icons on the map, feel free to put them where it is felt
they should be, but I will warn that most folks do not like the look of an icon on every single tile. So try to use them
sparingly in a manner such that the map does not become excessively cluttered.

That said, there may be something of a project that comes up in which tile icons are selectable as an overlay on the map,
I think this would be pretty cool, but have not worked anything specific out for it up to this point. The javascript for
map is also on this repository if anyone is interested in contributing towards that part of the project.

Thank you again, you are all a wonderful community!
